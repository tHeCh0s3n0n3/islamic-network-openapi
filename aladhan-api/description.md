# Introduction

A RESTful API to get islamic prayer times for a given day, month or year.

## Note 

The API has several endpoints to assist developers. All the endpoints return JSON and are available over `http` and `https`.

This documentation is incomplete, and currently a work in progress. The full documentation can be accessed [here](https://aladhan.com/prayer-times-api).

**NOTE: If you are using this API, please sign up to the developer mailing list [here](https://aladhan.com/contact) so you can be informed of any updates or scheduled maintenance to the API.**
